Versions and stability
----------------------

This package can be considered stable and ready to use. All releases follow the rules of 
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org).

Although the master branch is supposed to remain stable, there is not guarantee that braking changes will not
be merged into master when major versions are released. Therefore the repository contains version tags in 
order to support vendoring tools such as [glide](https://glide.sh). The tag names follow common conventions 
and have the following format `v1.0.0`.
